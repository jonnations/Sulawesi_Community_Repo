# Sulawesi_Community_Repo
Data and Scripts for Sulawesi Murine Community Ecospace Project

This repo contains all the data and scripts for this project. There are many steps involved from generating data to running predictive models to randomization analyses. Therefore, I will walk through the steps in this README

 - Organize and Process Raw Data

Most of the data in this project arrive here ready to go, including the stable isotope ratios and the external measurements. These data are stored in the directories `/~Isotope_Data` and `~/External_Measurement_Data` The exception is the raw landmark data from the cranial and dentary CT scans. These are processed in `geomorph`.
